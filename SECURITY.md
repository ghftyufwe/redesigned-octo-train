# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly. Report them privately to the project maintainers with enough detail to reproduce the issue, including affected endpoint/component, impact, and a safe reproduction where possible.

Do not include passwords, API keys, access tokens, private customer data, or other secrets in reports.

## Production security standard

SPR follows the controls documented in `docs/SECURITY_HARDENING.md`. Releases must pass the automated security gate before production deployment.

Security incidents are handled using `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`, which defines severity, evidence preservation, containment, authoritative investigation, recovery verification, communication and post-incident review.
